  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Hyper text markup language (HTML) is the basic markup language for creating Web pages.
  Using a series of elements with labels it begins to describe the structure of a Web Page.
  Each element has a specific purpose that is used in a specific order, from creating the layout
  of the Website to writing the contents. HTML is the coding behind how a web browser will display the information
  that has been written. </p>

<p>I chose this class for many reasons. First, I love creating and designing new things as 
I go in life. This class is giving me a chance to add a new capability. Second, I took dual credit 
Marketing sophomore year and I think this class will give me another avenue to use these skills for marketing. Thirdly, this class will 
include not only the design but a practical skill of how to set up each page. Lastly, I thought that this class would be 
an easy A but very quickly learning that it will take hard work but I love it every time I keep working on it. </p>
